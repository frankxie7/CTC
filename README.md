# 3110_final_project (Conquer the Caravan)

##
Our project is a dungeon climber game. It uses randomized cards to allow
users to defend against enemies on multiple floors. Players have to 
allocate energy to use cards effectively in order to succeed. Each level 
the enemies get harder to defeat, requiring both luck and skill from the 
player to succeed. 

Graphics and animations are generated using OCaml's tsdl library.
